# Neutrino oscillation parameters

Neutrinos, small subatomic particles, only interact through the weak force and gravity, which makes their detection challenging. Their unique characteristics include lack of electric charge, small mass and the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations. Large detectors are built to detect neutrinos, because they rarely interact with matter, which make them an interesting subject for in\-depth exploration within the area of particle physics. This project aims to measure neutrino oscillation parameters which arise due to the mismatch between neutrino flavour and mass eigenstates.

In a simplified two\-neutrino flavor scenario \($\nu_{\mu}$, $\nu_{\tau}$\), the muon neutrino survival probability is given by:

$P(\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow\nu_{\mu}) = 1 - \sin^{2}(2\theta)\sin^{2}(1.27\Delta m^{2}[eV^{2}]\frac{L [km]}{E[GeV]})$

where:

- $L$ is the distance traveled by neutrinos in kilometers,
- $E$ is the energy of the neutrinos in GeV,
- $\Delta m^{2} = m_{2}^{2} - m_{1}^{2}$ is the mass squared difference between the neutrino mass eigenstates,
- $\theta$ is the quantum mechanical mixing angle.

The analysis aims to determine the shape of the neutrino beam, predict the far detector spectrum for different neutrino oscillation parameters, and fit the far detector neutrino spectrum to find the best\-fit oscillation parameters. It will be conducted by analyzing the given dataset, which represents the correlation between the amount of detected neutrinos at certain distances compared to the neutrino energy through using Python.
